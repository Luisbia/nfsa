\title{Identify and Report Revisions in T0801SA (Seasonally Adjusted) Data}
\usage{
nfsa_revision_T0801SA(
  country,
  type = "vintage",
  abs_threshold = 10,
  rel_threshold = 0,
  output_sel = here::here("output", "revisions")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{country}{A character vector specifying the country or countries to analyze.
This should correspond to the country codes used in the input file names.}

\item{type}{Either to compare with the last version of the previous quarter ("vintage") or with the previous version of this quarter ("version")}

\item{abs_threshold}{A numeric value specifying the minimum absolute revision value to consider.
Revisions with an absolute value less than this threshold will be filtered out. Defaults to 10.}

\item{rel_threshold}{A numeric value specifying the minimum relative revision value (as a percentage of GDP) to consider.
Revisions with an absolute relative value less than this threshold will be filtered out. Defaults to 0.}

\item{output_sel}{A character string specifying the path to the directory where the output Excel file will be saved.
Defaults to \code{here("output", "revisions")}.}
}
\value{
This function returns a data frame containing the identified revisions and saves an Excel file
to the specified output directory. If no revisions meet the threshold criteria, a message will be displayed in the console.
}
\description{
This function identifies and reports revisions between two versions of T0801SA data.
It compares the \code{obs_value} in the new and previous datasets, calculates the absolute and
relative revisions, and filters the results based on specified thresholds.

This is a wrapper around \code{nfsa_revision()} for backward compatibility.
Consider using \code{nfsa_revision(table = "T0801SA")} directly.
